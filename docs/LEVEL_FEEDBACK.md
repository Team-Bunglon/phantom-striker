# Level Feedback
This document serves as my comment and feedback for each level as well as any changes I made to balance the game and make it look prettier. All comments and changes are categorized into five categories:

**[GENERAL]**  
Some general comment and changes I make for your level. 

**[TUTORIAL]**  
Informing you about the usage of TutorialBox if your level needs it. I'll also describe how your level indirectly teaches the player about the mechanic of the game or how the player would approach your level without telling. This is great since learning from experience (such as these indirect tutorial, trial and error, and experimentation) are great way to learn about the game than telling you directly with tutorial box (though we still need it for any mechanic that's not too obvious to know immediately).

**[CHALLENGE]**  
The challenge that the level serves. Does your level have the right amount of challenge? I may change your level to balance its challenge to make it not too easy but not too hard either.

**[GUIDELINE VIOLATION]**  
Any violation in the "Level Design" section of the Guideline (called as **LDG** for "Level Design Guideline" for brevity) your level may have. Violating most of these guidelines aren't a big deal since most of them are just minor annoyance and I can exempt some of these violation if your level is very good.

However, LDG 2, 5, 6, 9, 10 are a big no-no and your level will be modified greatly in order to abide with these rules. LDG 9 in particular will be described in its own category described as below as [SPITEFUL].

**[SPITEFUL]**  
Any violation for LDG 9 specifically. I put this as its own category as any spiteful game design does NOT increase challenge. Rather, it increases the frustration of the player which will make them quit the game too quickly. We want to encourage the player to finish the game, not push them away from the goal.

**Some Note**
- I may refer level as "room" and I'll use the two terms interchangebly.
- Not every level in this docs will have all categories. That's just waste of time.

## Level 1
Name: Let's Begin -> Strike at the Root  
Author: Me 

**[TUTORIAL]**  
This level should teach the player the control of the strike. We should let them experience the mechanic by trying to jump over the second pillar in two ways. I also planned to make the player to perform "Wall Jump" at the eastern wall but I decided to just add some ledge and make the tech optional for platformer enthusiast and speedrunner.

## Level 2
Name: Watch your Step!  
Author: Me

**[TUTORIAL]**  
Teaches about the pit, spike, and launch speed maintenance. This level requires the player to have a decent amount of reaction time when trying to jump over the large pit.

## Level 3
Name: Illusion of Choice  
Author: Azka

**[GENERAL]**  
The level layout is fine, I just add some tiles to make the level look more natural.

**[TUTORIAL]**  
Teaches the player that the bottom pit at the right will always kill you, true to the room name.  

Also, you don't need to strike to the platform even once to complete the level. Is striking even a choice?

## Level 4
Name: Jump of Faith -> Leap of Faith  
Author: Azka

**[GENERAL]**  
The big problem of this level is that it's too similar with the previous level. I ended up just redesign the level to make it true to its original name.

**[CHALLENGE]**  
The player should maintain their height away from the spike with their strike.

## Level 5
Name: Platform of Spikes -> Xylematic Platform  
Author: Ivan

**[GENERAL]**  
This level was problematic during the playtesting stage due to the single spike at the most top right platform in the level. Fortunately, you remove that spike in your commit so I appreciate that. I just added a collectible, rename the level, and very tiny adjustment as your level is very fine as it is. Though the lower-right portion of the level feels underutilized.

## Level 6
Name: Stairs of Spikes -> Step by Step  
Author: Ivan

**[GENERAL]**  
This level is just so easy I just end up adding more spikes. Maybe I switch this with level 5. Though this level feels quite satisfying if you are trying to speedrun it.

Also, can you be a little bit more creative with the naming? Not just "[Stuff] of Spikes"?

## Level 7
Name: Stairs of Spikes -> Step by Step  
Author: Ivan

**[GENERAL]**  
You forgot to change the level name, don't you? It's a fine level, but I have replace your old moving platform

## Level 8
Name: Shine Bright Like A Diamond -> Like a Diamond

**[GENERAL]**  
The level name reminds me of Yakuza/Like a Dragon series so I simplify it.

## Level 11
Name: Rising Tension  
Author: Me

**[CHALLENGE]**  
I could remove the bottom with a pit but I guess I should give the player a chance to recover back to the starting platform as soon as it regenerates.

## Level 12
Name: On a Prickly Path  
Author: Me

**[GENERAL]**  
If you know where the level name and the collectible's text come from, I'll give you a hug.

**[TUTORIAL]**  
Teach the player about reducing vertical distance when launching by holding down the crouch button button before striking.

**[CHALLENGE]**  
The challenge is about the timing of the strike when launching in between the tunnel of spikes.

### Level 21
Name

**[GENERAL]**  
This level is painful to make as not only I have to make the proper spawner, I have

**[CHALLENGE]**
