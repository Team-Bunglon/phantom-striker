# Guidelines
1. Please only use English when involving everything within this repository (commit message, merge request, variables, comments, etc.)
2. Always pull from `main`. Do NOT directly push to `main` branch. See [Merging](#merging).
3. As an extention to previous rule, always base your branch with the latest commit from `main` before pushing.
4. Only use lowercase name for every created file and directory except markdown files (e.g. `README.md`).
5. Try to make your changes as minimal and efficient as possible. 
6. Try to finish your task before the set deadline. 
7. If you need to use godot addon or external assets, make sure you have the right license or permission to use. Credit them at the repo's README.
8. If you use an external editor, put any unimportant directories or files that the editor may generate into `.gitignore` (e.g. `.idea` for Intellij IDE).

# Merging
1. Create a new branch from `main`. I recommend using your name as a branch.
2. After committing your changes, __always do a git pull from `main`__. I recommend setting your pull strategy to `rebase`.
3. Once you have the latest commit from `main` in your branch, push into the new branch.
4. Create a merge request. Any new request will be automatically notified through Discord.

# Level Design

# Level Name
This is more of a "suggestion" than a "rule" to help you come up with a good and creative name for your level name. Feel free to use your own strategy to create a good name. 

1. Always use English unless you have a good, specific reason why the room name cannot be named in English or must be in the used Language.
2. The name should describe the level in one, short sentence. It could be what the level has or what the player must be doing to complete it. 
3. Referencing other media (Literature, Music, Movie, TV, Other Games, etc.) is encouraged. Make sure the reference comes from a media that aren't too obscure in the general public.

Check out the gameplay of [VVVVVV](thelettervsixtim.es) and [Katgon Dungeon](https://team-bunglon.itch.io/katgon-dungeon) whose room names are a great inspiration for the level name.

# Reources
- [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org/) has a vast library of game assets we can use and this is the recommended place to find assets.
- [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/) also has a collection of high-quality, free assets. However, it may clashes with the game's artstyle. 
- [Youtube](https://youtube.com/) may have many free-to-use audio assets available. Make sure the creator is fine with you using their creation. A rule of thumb is that if there's no mention about using their creation for your project in the description, you do not have their permission and you should directly ask them for it.
