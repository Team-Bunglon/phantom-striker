# Mandatory Task
As usual, every team member creates 2 levels per person. While the order doesn't matter for now, each person takes the level number provided below which serve as the level's filename and it should prevent any clashing filename during merging. Once all 30 levels are created, the level will be ordered by its judged difficulty and complexity. 

Please choose the level number you want to pick on Discord:
- Level 11-12
- Level 13-14
- Level 15-16
- Level 17-18
- Level 19-20

# Specified Task
These are task for specific person to do.

### Rayhan
That's me!
#### 1. Fine tuning of the player control
After some feedback from our playtesting, our game feels too fast to be played. I'll adjust some variables for our player character to ensure he doesn't feel too fast and inaccurate to control. It does mean that he may lose some distance and jump height after finetuning so you may need to readjust your previous level to be beatable.

#### 2. Title, Pause, and Options Menu
Title Screen menu:
- Continue (greyed out for now)
- Start Game
- Options
- Quit

Pause Menu:
- Continue
- Restart from beginning
- Options
- Quit

The pause menu will show the death count as well as the current time. I will be accessible using the `pause` button (Escape key).

Options Menu:
- Volume for BGM (Background Music)
- Volume SFX (Sound Effect)
- Resolution scaling (Integer scaling from 1x to x4) with the base resolution of 640x480
- Fullscreen
- Game Speed (0.9x to 0.5x)
- Exit

#### 3. Unstrikeable Tilemap
Tilemaps which the character's strike won't react to. He'll stay in his position as if he strikes at nothing. This is already implemted and the only thing I need to do is to create an asset for it (which is just a copy of our regular tilemap but with different color at the edge).

#### 4. Visual Assets
I will also do any visual asset that we may need. Feel free to use any visual asset that you find as a placeholder since I will recreate them in my own artstyle.

### Azka
#### Create a jump particle
Just do what you have done with the strike particle. Try to make an entire new particle node on your own.

# Selectable Task
These are four tasks for each team member other than me that you can pick freely (since I already have a task of my own). One task is for one team member. Please choose on the Discord Server.

### Disintegrating Platform
This platform will slowly disintegrate when the player steps on it. Once it is fully disintegrated, the player will fall through it. The platform will return to its original state after set duration.

Criteria:
- Find or create a new 16x16 sprite sheet that shows each stages of disintegrations (preferably 3 frames) as well as a frame that shows the block after it's fully disintegrated (either as an outline of the block or as a greyed out version of the first frame). There will be 5 frames in a single spritesheet.
- The platform will have two states. `solid`, `crumbling`, and `broken`. All platform will start at `solid` state. After the player steps on it or strike it from any direction, it will go into `crumbling` state where the disintegration animation would play. After it finishes, it'll go to `broken` state where all of its collision is disabled. After a set duration, the platform will go back to`solid` state without animation.
	- Use the Animation Player and Timer node and take advantage of signals in Godot.
- If the player is inside the platform while in `broken` state and the timer for staying at this state has run out, the platform will go into `solid` state as soon as the player moves away from the platform's collision.
	- Use Area2D node.
- Make it as a StaticBody node (or tilemap if possible).
- Use something like the spike detection and the strike logic in `player.gd` to trigger the disintegration processs.

### Destroyable Platform
Destroyable platform will act like a normal tilemap when the character walks on it. However, as soon as it is struck, the platform will be destroyed and all of its collision will be disabled. The character will still receive the strike reaction as normal. After sometimes, the platform will return to its original state. This is a simpler version of disintegrating platform mentioned previously.

Criteria:
- Find or create a new 16x16 sprite sheet that shows the two states mention at the next point (two frames in total).
- There will be two states, `solid` and `broken` state. All platform will start at `solid` state. After the player strikes on it from any direction, it will go into `broken` state without animation and all of its collision will be disabled. After a set duration, the platform will go back into `solid` state without animation.
	- Use the Animation Player and Timer node and take advantage of signals in Godot.
- If the player is inside the platform while in `broken` state and the timer for staying at this state has run out, the platform will go into `solid` state as soon as the player moves away from the platform's collision.
	- Use Area2D node.
- Make it as a StaticBody node (or tilemap if possible).
- Feel free to add particle to make the destruction looks more polished.
- Use the strike logic at `player.gd` to trigger the destruction process.

### Moving Platform and Hazard
These platform and hazard will move automatically (horizontally or vertically) at a set speed. It can be spawned multiple times from a spawner offscreen or a set object that moves back and forth in the level.

Criteria:
- Find or create two sprite sheet that represents a moving platform and hazard. The platform is 64x16 (4 tiles wide) while the hazard is 16x16.
- The platform will have one-way collision so the player can jump onto it directly from below. He can still strike onto it from any direction and receive the reaction.
- The hazard should have an area2D that kills the player character as its only collision. His strike should NOT react to these hazards, nor the hazard should be destroyed when being struck.
- Make it as a StaticBody or RigidBody (make sure that they cannot be moved by any external forces)

### Collectibles
The golden flowers are the main collectible in the game. While implementing collectible in general is easy (a youtube tutorial has it covered), the complexity comes at making it persistent. That is, it will NOT come back if you collect it, die, and restart the level. The collectible will only be refreshed at the start of a new game.

The way this can be done is by keeping track of which level the collectible has been obtained inside a list or dictionary that can be accessible anywhere (e.g. `global.gd`). Global variables (or "autoload" as Godot calls it) will not be reset when the individual level is reset. Use the level number as the tracker value and check if the collectible has been obtained at current level after the level restarts (or at `_ready()`).

One level should only have one collectible. Not every level need collectible. There should be a maximum of 10 collectibles for the entire game.

Criteria
- Find or create a simple 16x16 sprite. Remember that it takes a form of a golden flower.
- Make it as Area2D since the player simply needs to physically touch it in order to obtain it.
- Put the required variable inside `global.gd` under `globals` folder.
- Feel free to use animation player to make a simple idle animation as well as Particle Engine to create an effect when the player obtains it.

# Bonus Task:
Anybody, even more than one person, can pick this task even if they already pick any of the task previously mentioned. If this task is not completed by the current week's deadline, it will become the next mandatory task for the next week.

### Gate Tilemap 
What it means is that a tilemap that's in your way unless you collect all the keys in the level which will make it disappear and you are allowed to pass. This works exactly like the gate block in Celeste Chapter 2 except that the block disappears instead of moving somewhere else.

The key works like a normal collectible except that it is not persistent, meaning it will reset when the level reset. 

The simplest implementation is to count how many key that has been collected inside `level_class.gd`. If the collected keys is sufficient (as set in the gate's export variable), the gate will disappear.

If you are going to put a second gate with a different key from the first one, just create an entirely different gate tilemap and a counter for that gate. One level shouldn't have more than one gates.

Criteria:
- The tilemap will be yet another recolor of the regular tilemap
- The gate tilemap will act like regular tilemap when being walked on or struck upon.
- Find or create a simple 16x16 sprite for the key
- The tilemap should have an export variable that set how many keys the player should collect before unlocking it. As soon as the player collects the sufficient key, the gate will disappear.
