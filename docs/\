This document serves as my comment and feedback for each level as well as any changes I made to balance the game and make it look prettier. All comments and changes are categorized into five categories:

[GENERAL]
Some general comment and changes I make for your level. 

[TUTORIAL]
Informing you about the usage of TutorialBox if your level needs it. I'll also describe how your level indirectly teaches the player about the mechanic of the game or how the player would approach your level without telling. This is great since learning from experience (such as these indirect tutorial, trial and error, and experimentation) are great way to learn about the game than telling you directly with tutorial box (though we still need it for a mechanic that's not too obvious to know immediately).

[CHALLENGE]
The challenge that the level serves. Does your level have the right amount of challenge to not make it too easy or too hard?

[GUIDELINE VIOLATION]
Any violation in the "Level Design" section of the guideline. Violating most of these guidelines aren't a big deal since most of them are just minor and you may make a level so good some violation will be exempted.

However, LD No. 2, 5, 6, 9, 10 are a big no-no and your level will be modified greatly in order to abide with these rules. LD No. 9 in particular will be described in its own category described as below as [SPITEFUL].

[SPITEFUL]
Any violation for "Level Design" Number 9 specifically. I put this as its own as any spiteful game design does NOT increase challenge. Rather, it increases the frustration of the player which will make them . We want to encourage the player to finish the game, not push them away from the goal.
